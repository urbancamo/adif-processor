# adif-processor
Processor for Amateur Radio ADIF files.
Written by Mark Wickens [mark@wickensonline.co.uk](mailto:"mark@wickensonline.co.uk").

Currently the post-processor can generate three types of output:
  - Enriched ADIF 
  - Google Earth KML file 
  - Pretty Printed contact listing file.

The post-processor knows summit references for the [HEMA](http://hema.org.uk/) [SOTA](https://www.sota.org.uk/), [WOTA](https://wota.org.uk).

## The ADIF format 30 second Primer
[ADIF](http://adif.org/) _Amateur Data Interchange Format_ is a text file representation for Amateur radio contacts. It is a popular
output format for logging programs. The [ADIF specification](https://adif.org/312/ADIF_312.htm) describes the valid content of the header and record fields.

An ADIF file consists of two sections:

- header
- records

###Fields in an ADIF file
Each field in the file is proceeded by a field name separated by the length of the field value with a colon.
For example: `<PROGRAMID:3>FLE` indicates the field is `PROGRAMID` and the text contained in the field
is `3` characters long with a value of `FLE`.

###Header
The header contains information about the program that generate the file and the ADIF version, for example:

```
ADIF Export for Fast Log Entry by DF3CB
<PROGRAMID:3>FLE
<ADIF_VER:5>3.1.0
<EOH>
```

The header is terminated with the `<EOH>` marker.

###Records

Each record captures all the details of a QSO for both the recording station and the contacted station. 
A record is terminated by the `<EOF>` marker.

Here is an example entry in a [Fast Log Entry](https://df3cb.com/fle/) input file:

```
40m ssb 7.090
1258 g7las/p 7.188 <OP: Rob, PWR: 50, GRID: IO81LC, HEMA: G/HWB-026>
```

This is the ADIF record generated by [Fast Log Entry](https://df3cb.com/fle/). These 
are typically stored on one line. In this case I've separated
each field of a record into a single line:

```
<STATION_CALLSIGN:7>M0NOM/P 
<CALL:7>G7LAS/P 
<QSO_DATE:8>20210522 
<TIME_ON:4>1258 
<BAND:3>40m 
<MODE:3>SSB 
<FREQ:5>7.188 
<RST_SENT:2>59 
<RST_RCVD:2>59 
<COMMENT:47>OP: Rob, PWR: 50, GRID: IO81LC, HEMA: G/HWB-026 
<QSLMSG:44>Thx for QSO from Winter Hill io83ro G/SP-010 
<MY_SOTA_REF:8>G/SP-010 
<OPERATOR:5>M0NOM 
<MY_GRIDSQUARE:6>IO83ro 
<EOR>
```

Note that the QSO has a `<STATION_CALLSIGN:7>` (me) and a `<CALL:7>` G7LAS/P who is on the other end, a date and time, frequency, band, mode, signal reports,
my SOTA reference `<MY_SOTA_REF:8>`, the operator (basically my callsign without any modifiers) and my Maidenhead
Locator in `<MY_GRIDSQUARE:6>`.

Of interest is the comment line, which we will examine further, as this is one of the key features of post-processing.
In the comment line:

`<COMMENT:47>OP: Rob, PWR: 50, GRID: IO81LC, HEMA: G/HWB-026
`

You will notice that it consists of a number comma-separated key-value pairs. For example, the first
pair key is `OP` with value `ROB`, then `PWR` value `50` etc.

## History
The first version of the post-processor was written to post-process comments against records
in the output from [Fast Log Entry](https://df3cb.com/fle/) to add additional information into
the ADIF file.
